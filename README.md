# My very first web page

Welcome! [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net)

## There are three links across this website - Stream One (Index), Stream Two and Stream Three. Each page contain various embedded links to programming paradigms.

##### This is a basic design level and so far it has been a little challenging but rewarding experience. I plan to develop my skills further as I progress through Code Institute's Full Stack Web Developer course. The technology used here are HTML and CSS using GitPod, with GitHub as the host.
